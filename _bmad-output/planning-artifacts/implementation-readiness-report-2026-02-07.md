- **FR1:** Rodrigo can import Excel of input containing temas, focos and períodos
- **FR2:** The system validates the structure of the Excel input and reports errors before processing
- **FR3:** Rodrigo can define if sub-focos are generated by AI or provided manually

#### Question Generation Pipeline (FR4-FR9)
- **FR4:** The system generates sub-focos in blocks (batch of 50) from a focus
- **FR5:** The Agente Criador generates complete question (enunciado + 4 alternatives + gabarito + educational objective)
- **FR6:** The system randomly draws the position of the correct alternative (A/B/C/D) with statistical balancing before generation
- **FR7:** The Agente Criador automatically selects the appropriate enunciado type for theme, focus and level
- **FR8:** The system applies 3 difficulty levels mapped to Bloom's Taxonomy
- **FR9:** The system constructs distractors by cognitive nature of difficulty level

#### Quality & Validation (FR10-FR18)
- **FR10:** The Agente Comentador analyzes the question without knowing the gabarito and declares which alternative it considers correct
- **FR11:** The Agente Comentador generates complete structured commentary (Introdução → Visão Específica → Alt. by Alt. → Visão do Aprovado)
- **FR12:** The Agente Validador compares Criador's gabarito with Comentador's response and issues approval or rejection
- **FR13:** The Agente Validador provides feedback by error categories (ambiguous enunciado, weak distractors, questionable gabarito, incomplete commentary, off-level)
- **FR14:** The system resends rejected questions to Criador with Validador feedback (max 2-3 rounds)
- **FR15:** The system routes questions without approval after limit to human review queue
- **FR16:** The system executes checkpoints every 10 focos, with sample of 5 questions for human validation

- **Clinical Relevance Filter:** Avoid ultra-specificities without value for students

#### Bibliographic Reference Rules
- **Inviolable Rule:** NEVER generate non-existent references
- **Primary Source:** RAG with curated documents as primary source for Comentador
- **Permitted Sources List:** Restricts reference space by period/theme
- **Verifiable Reference:** Each question with verifiable reference in corresponding Excel column

#### Educational Context
- **Difficulty Calibration:** By period: 1st-2nd year (basic cycle) vs 3rd-4th year (clinical cycle)
- **Bloom's Taxonomy:** Applied to 3 difficulty levels
- **SUS Alignment:** Content aligned with SUS reality and Brazilian medical practice
- **Brazilian Portuguese:** Medical terminology in Brazilian Portuguese

#### AI Risk Mitigation
- **Multi-Agent Pipeline:** With blind review as primary quality control

- **Duplicity Control:** Via educational objective per question
- **Managed Creative Temperature:** Avoids repetition without sacrificing quality
- **Cognitive Distractors:** Reflect real student cognitive errors, not absurd alternatives
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Via metrics dashboard to detect degradation

#### Business Constraints
- **Deadline:** ~8,000 questions generated and validated by **February 14, 2026**
- **Single User:** Rodrigo Franco — sole system user
- **Output Delivery:** Structured Excel ready for delivery to import team
- **Complete Coverage:** All themes and focos from input spreadsheet (1st-4th year)
- **Statistical Balancing:** Correct position (A/B/C/D), difficulty levels (Bloom), enunciado types
- **Optimized Cost:** Best quality/cost ratio among tested models

## UX Alignment Assessment

### UX Document Status

❌ **No dedicated UX design document found**

However, UI/UX requirements **ARE defined** - they are embedded within the PRD and Architecture rather than in a separate UX document.

### UX Requirements Inventory (from PRD)

**Dashboard Interface (Streamlit) - Epic 4:**

**Configuration Sidebar (FR33-FR37, Story 4.7):**
- Model selection dropdown (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, etc.)
- Temperature slider (0.0-1.0)
- Retry limit input (1-5)
- Batch size configuration (10-100)
- Checkpoint interval (5-20 focos)
- Concurrency control (1-10)
- Prompt editor (text area for each agent)

**Overview Page (FR31, Story 4.2):**
- Progress metrics (total/approved/rejected/failed)
- Progress bar (Foco X of Y)
- Time elapsed and estimated
- Accumulated cost display
- Line chart: Questions approved by foco
- Pie chart: Status distribution
- Recent questions table

**Metrics Page (FR27-FR29, Story 4.3):**
- Real-time KPIs: approval rate, cost, concordância, latency
- Approval rate over time (line chart)
- Accumulated cost chart
- Cost by model (bar chart)
- Latency by agent (line chart)
- Cost projection display

**Model Comparison Page (FR30, Story 4.4):**
- Comparison table (model, questions, approval rate, cost, latency, concordância)
- Scatter plot: cost vs approval rate
- Grouped bar chart: latency by agent and model
- Recommendation section

**Checkpoint View Page (FR16, FR18, Story 4.5):**
- Checkpoint list (ID, foco range, date, status, approval rate)
- Expandable checkpoint details with statistics
- Sample question display (5 questions with full commentary)
- Approve/Reject buttons for pending checkpoints

**Incident Log Page (FR32, Story 4.6):**
- Two tabs: Point Errors vs Systemic Errors
- Error tables with filters
- Error category chart (bar chart)
- Systemic incident timeline

**Interactive Features:**
- Command-line controls (--start, --pause, --resume, --status, --export)
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds
- Manual refresh button
- Export to CSV functionality

### UX ↔ PRD Alignment

✅ **Fully Aligned** - All UI requirements from PRD are detailed and actionable:
- User journeys explicitly define dashboard usage (Jornada 1 & 2)
- Configuration needs mapped to sidebar controls
- Monitoring needs mapped to metrics pages
- Checkpoint validation workflow defined
- Error analysis interface specified

### UX ↔ Architecture Alignment

✅ **Architecture Supports All UX Requirements:**

**Technology Choice:**
- Streamlit selected explicitly for rapid dashboard development (Architecture doc)
- Sidebar API provides configuration controls
- Multi-page app structure supports navigation
- Real-time updates via st.rerun() every 5 seconds

**Data Flow:**
- Dashboard reads from SQLite (tables: questions, metrics, checkpoints, batch_state)
- Configuration changes update PipelineConfig
- All visualizations sourced from persistent data

**Epic 4 Implementation:**
- Story 4.1: Dashboard entry point and navigation
- Stories 4.2-4.6: Each page with specific visualizations
- Story 4.7: Configuration sidebar
- All UI components have corresponding backend support

**Performance Considerations:**
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds (not blocking)
- Manual refresh option available
- Dashboard independent from pipeline execution

### Assessment: UX Approach

**Status:** ⚠️ **Acceptable with Notation**

**Approach Used:** Embedded UX specification within PRD/Architecture (not separate UX document)

**Why This Works for This Project:**

1. **Single Power User:** Rodrigo Franco (technical user, content producer) - not consumer-facing
2. **Developer Tool Context:** Streamlit dashboard for pipeline monitoring - functional over aesthetic
3. **MVP Time Pressure:** 7-day deadline (Feb 14) prioritizes working software
4. **UX Complexity is Low:** Standard dashboard patterns, Streamlit defaults acceptable
5. **Iterative Refinement Possible:** Single user can provide direct feedback during development
6. **Requirements ARE Specified:** Layout, controls, visualizations, and interactions clearly defined

**What's Missing (Low Impact):**
- ❌ No wireframes or mockups
- ❌ No visual design specifications (colors, typography, spacing)
- ❌ No user flow diagrams (though journeys provide narrative flow)
- ❌ No accessibility considerations (WCAG, screen readers)

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Streamlit provides sensible defaults, single user can adapt to interface
- **Recommendation:** Proceed with implementation; consider adding UX doc in Phase 2 (Growth) if additional users planned

### Alignment Issues

✅ **No critical alignment issues detected**

All UI requirements from PRD are supported by Architecture and covered in Epic 4 stories.

### Warnings

⚠️ **NOTATION:** No dedicated UX design document exists.

**Context:** This is acceptable for this project context (single technical user, MVP timeline, developer tool), BUT if the system expands to multiple users or non-technical users in the future, a formal UX design phase will be necessary.

**Recommendation for Current Phase (MVP):**
- ✅ Proceed with implementation - UX requirements sufficiently defined in PRD
- ✅ Epic 4 stories provide clear implementation guidance
- ✅ Streamlit defaults provide adequate UX for single power user

**Recommendation for Future Phases:**
- 📋 If expanding to multiple users: Create dedicated UX document with wireframes
- 📋 If adding non-technical users: Conduct user research and usability testing
- 📋 If pursuing Growth phase features: Consider UX refinement and visual design

### Detailed Epic Analysis

#### Epic 1: Fundação do Projeto e Infraestrutura Core

**User Value Assessment:** 🔴 **FAILS**
- Title: "Fundação do Projeto e Infraestrutura Core" - Technical title
- Goal: "Rodrigo pode inicializar o projeto, ler um Excel de input, escrever um Excel de output..."
- **Issue:** 6 of 8 stories are purely technical (1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.7, 1.8)
- **User value stories:** Only 1.5 (Excel reader) and 1.6 (Excel writer)

**Technical Stories (No Direct User Value):**
- Story 1.2: "Criar Modelos Pydantic de Dados" - Infrastructure
- Story 1.3: "Implementar Abstração de Provedores LLM" - Abstraction layer
- Story 1.4: "Configurar SQLite para Persistência" - Database setup
- Story 1.7: "Criar Hierarquia de Exceções Customizadas" - Error handling framework
- Story 1.8: "Configurar Gerenciamento de Secrets (.env)" - Security setup

**Independence:** ✅ PASSES - Epic 1 stands alone

**Acceptance Criteria:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Detailed UI specifications

### Quality Violations & Findings

#### 🔴 CRITICAL VIOLATIONS

**V1: Epic 1 is a Technical Epic**

**Description:** Epic 1 "Fundação do Projeto e Infraestrutura Core" bundles 6 technical setup stories with only 2 user-value stories.

**Evidence:**
- Stories about Pydantic models, LLM abstraction, exception hierarchies = zero direct user value
- Users don't benefit from "modelos Pydantic" or "hierarquia de exceções"
- Only Stories 1.5 (Excel import) and 1.6 (Excel export) deliver user-facing functionality

**Best Practice Violated:** "Epics must deliver user value, not be technical milestones"

**Impact:**
- Epic 1 completion doesn't deliver meaningful value to Rodrigo beyond Excel I/O
- Technical debt frontloaded instead of created when needed
- Violates incremental value delivery principle

**Remediation Options:**

1. **Option A - Accept as Pragmatic Compromise (RECOMMENDED)**
   - **Rationale:** 7-day deadline (Feb 14), infrastructure IS required before Epic 2 can start
   - **Mitigation:** Reframe Epic 1 goal to emphasize "Rodrigo can import and export Excel files"
   - **Document:** Note as technical debt to refactor in Phase 2 (Growth)
   - **Action:** Accept as-is with notation

2. **Option B - Restructure Epics (IDEAL but TIME-INTENSIVE)**
   - Move Story 1.2 (Pydantic models) to Epic 2 when first needed
   - Move Story 1.4 (SQLite) to when first persistence needed
   - Move Story 1.3 (LLM abstraction) to Epic 2 Story 2.1
   - Keep only 1.1, 1.5, 1.6 in Epic 1 (project init + Excel I/O)
   - **Impact:** Requires epic restructuring, delays implementation start

**Recommendation:** **ACCEPT AS-IS with notation** - Given tight deadline and greenfield context, pragmatically acceptable.

---

#### 🟠 MAJOR ISSUES

**M1: Database Tables Created Upfront**

**Description:** Story 1.4 creates ALL database tables (questions, metrics, checkpoints) in Epic 1, but:
- `questions` table not used until Epic 2
- `metrics` table not used until Epic 2/4
- `checkpoints` table not used until Epic 3

**Best Practice Violated:** "Create tables when first needed, not all upfront"

**Evidence from Story 1.4 Acceptance Criteria:**
```
**Then** a tabela `questions` é criada com colunas...
**And** a tabela `metrics` é criada...
**And** a tabela `checkpoints` é criada...
```

**Impact:**
- Schema changes in Epic 2/3 require modifying Epic 1 code
- Harder to trace which epic owns which tables
- Violates incremental development principle

**Remediation Options:**

1. **Option A - Accept as Pragmatic (RECOMMENDED)**
   - **Rationale:** SQLite schema is simple and well-defined in PRD
   - **Pragmatic:** Upfront schema design reduces migration complexity later
   - **Low Risk:** Schema unlikely to change dramatically
   - **Action:** Accept as-is

2. **Option B - Move Table Creation to First Use (IDEAL)**
   - Story 1.4: Create only database connection and migration framework
   - Story 2.8: Create `questions` and `metrics` tables when orchestrator needs them
   - Story 3.2: Create `checkpoints` table when checkpoint manager needs it
   - **Impact:** More aligned with best practices but adds complexity

**Recommendation:** **ACCEPT AS-IS** - Schema is comprehensive, unlikely to change, upfront creation acceptable for SQLite.

---

#### 🟡 MINOR CONCERNS

**C1: Missing CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

**Description:** No story explicitly sets up continuous integration or automated deployment pipeline

**Impact:** **Low** - Single developer, local execution, MVP focus, 7-day deadline

**Recommendation:** Add to Phase 2 (Growth) if team expands or deployment automation becomes necessary

---

**C2: Story 1.1 Covers Broad Project Initialization**

**Description:** Story 1.1 includes:
- `uv init` project creation
- All 8 module directories (models, agents, providers, pipeline, io, metrics, config, dashboard)
- All dependencies (openai, anthropic, pandas, openpyxl, pinecone, pydantic, streamlit, pytest, ruff)
- All configuration files (.env.example, .gitignore, pyproject.toml)

**Impact:** **Low** - Story still completable in single session, acceptance criteria are clear and specific

**Recommendation:** Acceptable for greenfield project initialization - common pattern for starter template projects

---

### Positive Findings

**Strengths:**
✅ **Epics 2-4 Exemplary** - Clear user value, proper independence, excellent acceptance criteria
✅ **Zero Forward Dependencies** - All dependencies flow backward (Epic N depends only on Epic N-1)
✅ **Strong FR Traceability** - 100% coverage, every FR maps to epic and story
✅ **Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria** - Given/When/Then format, testable, complete error handling
✅ **Appropriate Story Sizing** - 29 stories for 38 FRs (avg 1.3 FRs per story)
✅ **Logical Epic Sequencing** - Foundation → Pipeline → Production → Dashboard
✅ **Epic Independence Verified** - Each epic can function with only prior epics' outputs
✅ **Starter Template Requirement Met** - Story 1.1 includes `uv init` as specified in Architecture

### Context-Aware Assessment

**Project Context Considerations:**
- **Tight Deadline:** 7 days to Feb 14, 2026 - restructuring adds risk
- **Single Developer:** No team coordination overhead, technical stories won't block others
- **Greenfield Project:** Some upfront infrastructure setup is pragmatically necessary
- **Well-Defined Requirements:** Strong PRD reduces rework risk
- **Technical User:** Rodrigo Franco is a technical power user, not general consumer

**Given Context:**
- Epic 1 technical nature is a **documented compromise** rather than a fatal flaw
- Violations are **non-blocking** for implementation
- Epic structure is **implementable and will deliver required functionality**

### Final Quality Verdict

**PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTATION AS-IS**

**Rationale:**
1. Violations identified are **pragmatically acceptable** given deadline and context
2. Epics 2-4 are **excellent** - user-centric, independent, well-structured
3. Epic 1 technical nature is **acknowledged and documented** as compromise
4. No **blocking issues** that would prevent successful implementation
5. **100% FR coverage** with strong traceability maintained

**Required Actions:**
1. ✅ Document Epic 1 as technical epic (pragmatic compromise for deadline)
2. ✅ Consider post-MVP refactoring in Phase 2 if timeline permits
3. ✅ Emphasize Stories 1.5-1.6 (Excel I/O) as Epic 1's core user value

**Quality Score:** **B+ (Very Good)** - Strong overall structure with documented compromises appropriate to context.

- Epic structure is implementable
- Issues identified are non-blocking and accepted as pragmatic compromises

**Constraints Acknowledged:**
- ⏰ Tight deadline: 7 days to February 14, 2026
- 👤 Single developer + single user (Rodrigo Franco)
- 🆕 Greenfield project requiring infrastructure setup
- 🎯 MVP focus: functionality over polish

---

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

✅ **NONE - No blocking issues identified**

All critical findings have been assessed and **accepted as pragmatic compromises** appropriate to project context:

1. **Epic 1 Technical Nature** (originally critical) → **ACCEPTED**
   - Context: Greenfield project requires infrastructure before user features
   - Mitigation: Stories 1.5-1.6 (Excel I/O) provide user value
   - Impact: Non-blocking for 7-day deadline

2. **No Dedicated UX Document** (originally warning) → **ACCEPTED**
   - Context: Single technical user, developer tool, Streamlit defaults sufficient
   - Mitigation: UI requirements defined in PRD Epic 4
   - Impact: Non-blocking for MVP phase

---

### Issues Documented for Context

#### 🟠 Major Issues (Accepted as Pragmatic)

**M1: Epic 1 is Technical Epic**
- **Status:** Documented compromise
- **Rationale:** Greenfield infrastructure needed before Epic 2 can function
- **Action:** Proceed as-is, consider refactoring in Phase 2 (Growth) if timeline permits

**M2: Database Tables Created Upfront in Story 1.4**
- **Status:** Accepted (schema unlikely to change)
- **Rationale:** SQLite schema is well-defined in PRD, upfront creation reduces complexity
- **Action:** Proceed as-is

#### 🟡 Minor Concerns (Low Impact)

**C1: Missing CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
- **Impact:** Low - single developer, local execution
- **Recommendation:** Add in Phase 2 if team expands

**C2: Story 1.1 Covers Broad Initialization**
- **Impact:** Low - still completable in single session
- **Recommendation:** Acceptable for greenfield starter template

---

### Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (Ready to Begin):**

1. **✅ PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION**
   - All planning artifacts validated and ready
   - Epic 1 Story 1.1: Initialize project with `uv init construtor-de-questoes --python 3.11`
   - Begin systematic execution of Epic 1 stories (1.1 → 1.2 → ... → 1.8)

2. **📋 Track Progress Against Epics**
   - Use epic/story structure as implementation roadmap
   - 29 stories provide clear checkpoints
   - Maintain FR traceability during implementation

3. **⏰ Monitor Deadline Progress**
   - Deadline: February 14, 2026 (7 days from assessment)
   - Epic 1: Days 1-3 (8 stories)
   - Epic 2: Days 3-5 (8 stories)
   - Epic 3: Days 5-6 (6 stories)
   - Epic 4: Days 6-7 (7 stories)

**During Implementation:**

4. **🎯 Prioritize MVP Scope**
   - Epic 1-3 are CRITICAL for 8,000 questions by Feb 14
   - Epic 4 (Dashboard) can be simplified if time-constrained
   - Metrics can start as CSV/logs, migrate to Streamlit when ready (as noted in PRD)

5. **📊 Leverage Checkpoints**
   - Epic 3 Story 3.2: Checkpoints every 10 focos with 5-question samples
   - Use for quality validation during mass production
   - Rodrigo provides real-time feedback to adjust parameters

6. **💰 Monitor Costs from Day 1**
   - Epic 1 Story 1.4: Metrics logged from first question
   - Use Story 2.1 calibration (30 questions) to compare models
   - Make data-driven model selection before mass production (Epic 3)

**Post-MVP (Phase 2 - Growth):**

7. **🔄 Consider Epic 1 Refactoring**
   - If timeline permits, redistribute technical stories to when first needed
   - Not urgent - current structure is implementable

8. **🎨 UX Enhancement (if expanding beyond single user)**
   - Add dedicated UX document with wireframes
   - Conduct usability testing if non-technical users added
   - Visual design refinement for Dashboard

9. **🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Add if team expands or deployment automation becomes necessary
